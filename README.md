# Welcome!


Here we give images and instructions how to prepare smart devices for the [CyBear Jinni Smart Home](https://github.com/CyBear-Jinni/CBJ_Smart-Home) system.

The smart devices use this snap to run 

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/cybear-jinni)

And the code of the snap can be found in the [**CyBear Jinni Smart Device**](https://github.com/CyBear-Jinni/CBJ_Smart-Device.git) repository.
